# Impostor's Howto

A collection of notes for a meaningful software engineering career.

## How to Use

This is a collection of notes that I try to take when researching a software engineering or computer science topic.  

The notes are usually made with internal usage in mind to alleviate my poor memory and therefore tend to be exceedingly laconic. Use at your own dicretion.

## 1. Workflow, DX, DevOps and Infrastructure

DX stands for "Developer Experience", that is, getting a development workflow that is stable, reproducible, and easy to use. 
My notes focus on making it work on a Windows PC while using containers, WSL, and remote Linux/PAAS machines where possible.
