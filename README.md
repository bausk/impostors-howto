# Impostor's Howto

A collection of notes for a meaningful software engineering career.

## How to Use

This is a collection of notes that I try to take when researching a software engineering or computer science topic. These are mostly original research and compilations where a single source isn't present (see [Laconic](https://github.com/bausk/laconic) for single-source notes).  

The notes are usually made with internal usage in mind to alleviate my poor memory and therefore tend to be exceedingly laconic. Use at your own dicretion.

## Foundational Reading

* [Laconic](https://github.com/bausk/laconic) Notes that materialize my takeaways from reading other people's works (books, posts, and whitepapers)

## 1. DevOps and Deployment

## 2. Concurrency and Execution Models

* [`asyncio` Seminar given at Webinerds in Dnipro, 2018](https://github.com/bausk/seminar2018)

## 3. Machine Learning
